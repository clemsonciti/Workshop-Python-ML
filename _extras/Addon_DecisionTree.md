# Decision Tree
## Splitting algorithm

- Gini Impurity: (Categorical)
- Chi-Square index (Categorical)
- Cross-Entropy & Information gain (Categorical)
- Reduction Variance (Continuous)

### Gini Impurity

#### Example on Decision Tree with Gini Impurity
Assume we have a sample data of 30 students with three variables Gender (Boy/ Girl), Class( IX/ X) and Height (5 to 6 ft).
 - 15 out of these 30 play cricket in leisure time. 
 - predict who will play cricket during leisure period?
