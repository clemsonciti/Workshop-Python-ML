# Evaluation Metrics

- Evaluation Metric is an essential part in any Machine Learning project.
- It measures how good or bad is your Machine Learning model
- Different Evaluation Metrics are used for Regression model (Continuous output) or Classification model (Categorical output).

## Regression model Evaluation Metrics

### Correlation Coefficient (R) or Coefficient of Determination (R2):

```python
from sklearn import metrics
metrics.r2_score(y_test,y_pred)
```

### Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) or Mean Square Error (MSE)

```python
from sklearn import metrics
metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test,y_pred,squared=False) # RMSE
metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test,y_pred,squared=True) # MSE
```

## Classification model Evaluation Metrics

### Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix is a technique for summarizing the performance of a classification algorithm.
You can learn more about Confusion Matrix [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/04/confusion-matrix-machine-learning/)

For binary output (classification problem with only 2 output type, also most popular):
