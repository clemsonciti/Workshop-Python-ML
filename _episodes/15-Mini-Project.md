# 15. MINI PROJECT

## Description of Mini Project: 

- This Mini Project evaluates the ability of you working on a sample Data Science project from scratch.
- The project is about Supervised Machine Learning only
- It requires you to download data, clean data, split into training/testing and apply any machine learning model and analyse the output.


## Requirement:
- You can write the script in Jupyter Notebook and save it as your_username.ipynb and send it to my email: **tuev@clemson.edu**
- **Note**: in order to get the **Certificate of Attendence**, you should send me the ipynb script on or before **06/30/2021**.

## Data
- You can use *any* data in your field of expertise (most preferred method). If so, please send along the dataset with the ipynb file
- You can also use *Kaggle* data which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) (second preferred method). Please elaborate in the ipynb how did you retrieve the data
- You can use use *Titanic* data from our [repo](https://github.com/clemsonciti/Workshop-Python-ML/tree/master/data/Titanic_data)
Description for Titanic data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
